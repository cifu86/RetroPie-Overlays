**There are multiple sets of overlays in this folder, here is a rundown:**

Full Screen - just the core provided emulator settings, NO INTEGER SCALE
 
  * The full screen files are just borders and require no fancy video settings. 

  * They support both 4:3 and 1:1 aspect ratios.

Integer Scale - Use these when applying an overlay to an integer scaled image.

  * The integer scale files are ripped directly from the SNES Mini with no modifications

  * They support both 4:3 and 1:1. use the video settings above depending on which aspect ratio you want to use.
